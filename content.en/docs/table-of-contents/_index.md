The resources on these pages are predominantly intended for use by undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students wishing to learn to use the powerful (yet initially complex) EEGLAB and ERPLAB software for data pre-processing. The website is owned & maintained by Jen Lewendon, postdoctoral researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi. 

Whilst a myriad of resources are available for the novice ERP researcher, the information on this website aims to fill a gap. Firstly, the **ERP Training Resources** pages aim to provide a full tutorial from instillation of EEG & ERP lab, to UI or script-based pre-processing and analysis. This should support the user with no prior MATLAB or EEGLAB/ERPLAB experience to get started with EEG data pre-processing. The course also offers practice datasets, scripts, and other resources to consolidate learning and allow for hands-on practice of the full pre-processing pipeline without the need for the user to acquire or source their own data. The course is particularly geared to support Mandarin speaking students to familiarise themselves with the often complex terminology and concepts of pre-processing, offering a wealth of translated content.

Secondly, the **External Resources & Publications** section of this website provides a repository of key literature to guide the learner through every stage of the ERP research process, from experiment design, data acquisition, pre-processing & analysis, and reporting. I do claim any ownership of these resources, but find them very useful in my own research.

Thirdly, the **Resources for Researchers** section features a number of databases and tools that may prove useful for ERP researchers conducting research into auditory ERP responses. This comes from my own work, and is mostly unpublished resources.

Finally the **Teaching Material** section combines both my own materials and external content to help design course content at tertiary level for ERP studies.
