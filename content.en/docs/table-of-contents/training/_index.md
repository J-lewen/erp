The following pages are intended to form a complete course for beginners on ERP pre-processing and analysis in MATLAB. The course assumes no prior knowledge of MATLAB or ERPLAB, but does require a basic understanding of [EEG/ERP data and pre-processing stages](https://courses.erpinfo.org/courses/Intro-to-ERPs). The steps here follow guidelines for optimal ERP pre-processing steps in the order sppecified by Luck & Kappenman, taking into consideration the important concept of [linear and non-linerar operations](https://erpinfo.org/order-of-steps).

The course is split into X parts. Each part is intended to only last a couple of minutes, allowing you to dip in and out as required. The format is (mostly) consistent aross each parts as follows:

1. A brief description of the pre-processing operations;
2. A video to guide you through conducting the pre-processing operation(s) via the user interface (UI);
3. The code equivalent of the pre-processing steps conducted;
4. A complete script, compiles all pre-processing operations conducted up to (and including) the current page;
5. An example dataset (so that you can have a go);
6. Where relevant, a brief activity or task to consolidate understanding.
7. FAQs
