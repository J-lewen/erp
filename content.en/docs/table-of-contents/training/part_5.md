#### Data cleaning (or 'help, my data looks a mess')

<br>
<u> Intro</u>

Preamble: The most important thing to mention here is that there is no substitute for good quality data. You *must* ensure that the data you collect is the best it possible can be, because there is nothing you can do during pre-processing that can compensate for bad data. That said, even the best data will almost always have periods of noise. Why? because participants are only human. Give them a break in a testing session and they will almost inevitably move more than you thought humanly possible in the space of 30 seconds.

So, what should we do, and why do we need to clean our data?

<u> Activity</u>

Have a go at cleaning the dataset provided in ERPLAB. Pay close attention to when the triggers fall, and ensure that you don't unnecessarily remove trials by removing data that falls into the baseline period, or epoch of interest.
