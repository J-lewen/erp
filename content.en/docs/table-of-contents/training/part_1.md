#### Getting started (or 'help, how do I make ERPLAB work?')

<br>
<u> Intro</u>

To conduct any of the analyses featured in this tutorial, you require three downloads.

Firstly, **MATLAB**. MATLAB is a very powerful (see also 'very expensive') software programme. However, in order to use EEGLAB MATLAB is a pre-requisite. Luckily however they offer some pretty great discounts for [students](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/en/pricing-licensing.html?prodcode=ML&intendeduse=student), so it's well worth buying a student copy if that's a possibility. Universities will also often have a MATLAB license that you'll be able to use either on campus, or [link](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/licensecenter/licenses/add?uri=https://matlab.mathworks.com&s_tid=mlh_nl_link) to via your personal computer.

Next, you'll need to download [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php). EEGLAB is super handy open-access software intended for research purposes. EEGLAB is a necessary pre-requisite to ERPLAB, with which we'll conduct most of our pre-processing.

> **Steps**: Download EEGLAB from the above link. Extract the folder, then open MATLAB. Navigate to 'set path', which you can find in the Home tab in the Environment section. Select 'Add Folder' and navigate to the EEGLAB folder. You may then wish to select EEGLAB in the 'MATLAB search path' list and move it to the top, with the help of the 'Move to top' button on the left-hand side. For more details, click [here](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/downloadtoolbox.php/download.php)

Finally, you will need to download the [ERPLAB](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/releases) toolbox, some more great open-access software that will enable you to conduct pretty much any pre-processing operation you could want. To learn more about ERPLAB, have a read through [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00213/full) by Lopex-Calderon & Luck.

> **Steps**: Download ERPLAB from the above link. Extract the folder, Then place the extracted ERPLAB folder into your EEGLAB plugins folder.
