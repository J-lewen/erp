### Interpolation (or 'oops the eye electrode fell off my participant's face')
<br>

<u> Intro</u>

Whilst taking a look at your data, you may notice that certain electrodes that seem particularly noisy (i.e., fuzzy or making unpredictable leaps and falls). If this is the case, you may wish to interpolate them.

Interpolation - put simply - involves recreating one electrode from its surrounding electrodes.
