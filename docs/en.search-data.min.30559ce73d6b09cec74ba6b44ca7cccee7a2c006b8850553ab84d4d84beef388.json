The website is owned \u0026amp; maintained by Jen Lewendon, postdoctoral researcher at New York Universit Abu Dhabi.\nWhilst a myriad of resources exist for the novice ERP researcher, the information on this website aims to fill a gap. Firstly, the ERP Training Resources aim to provide a full tutorial from instillation of EEG and ERP lab, to UI and script-based pre-processing. This should support the user with no prior MATLAB or EEGLAB/ERPLAB experience to get started with EEG data pre-processing. The course also offers practice datasets, scripts, and other resources to consolidate learning and allow for hands-on practice of the full pre-processing pipeline without the need for the user to acquire or source their own data. The course is particularly geared to support Mandarin speaking students to familiarise themselves with the often complex teminology \u0026amp; concepts of pre-processing, offering a wealth of content translated to Mandarin.\nSecondly, the External Resources \u0026amp; Publications section of this website provides a repository of key literature to guide the learner through every stage of teh ERP research process, from experiment design, datat acquisition, pre-processing \u0026amp; analysis, and reporting. I do claim any ownership of these resources, but find them very useful in my own research.\nThirdly, the Resources for Researchers section features a number of databases and tools that may prove useful for ERP researchers conducting research into auditory ERP responses. This comes from my own work, and is mostly unpublished resources.\nFinally the Teaching Material section combines both my own materials and external content to help design course content at tiertiary level for ERP studies.\nYou are free (in fact, welcome) to use all and any of the resources on this site.

Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent aquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.\rWhilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical. Many ERP studies violate this principle, mostly because it is usually far easier to create stimuli that do not adhere to it.\nI want to run a study that examines how people respond to words that are related vs unrelated (see this article if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which component this experiment might study). Below are examples of my stimuli:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple garage\nHere, my targets (which I\u0026rsquo;ll measure my ERP response to) are psysically different. This introduces a potential secondary factor that might influence any results I find. Instead of being able to attribute any differences in my ERPs to related vs unrelated words, it\u0026rsquo;s very possible that a host of features (including the word length, orthography, frequency\u0026hellip; etc. etc.) might actually be the driving force behind any differences I find. Instead I could improve my design as follows:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple cat\nNow my ERPs are elicited by the word cat in both conditions, meaning that any physical differences between the conditions must arise purely from their relationship to the prime.\nThe Hillyard Priciple is by no means the only thing to consider in your design, but is a key design issue that necessitates further attention than it is typically afforded.

The course assumes no prior knowledge of MATLAB or ERPLAB, but does require a basic understanding of EEG/ERP data and pre-processing stages. The steps here follow guidelines for optimal ERP pre-processing steps in the order sppecified by Luck \u0026amp; Kappenman, taking into consideration the important concept of linear and non-linerar operations.\nThe course is split into X parts. Each part is intended to only last a couple of minutes, allowing you to dip in and out as required. The format is consistent aross each parts as follows:\nA brief description of the pre-processing operations; A video to guide you through conducting the pre-processing operation(s) via the user interface (UI); The code equivalent of the pre-processing steps conducted; A complete script, compiles all pre-processing operations conducted up to (and including) the current page; An example dataset (so that you can have a go); Where relevant, a brief activity or task to consolidate understanding.

To ensure the reliability and replicability of ERP research output, it is therefore crucial that researchers avoid practises (all too common to the field) prone to result in erroneous effects, and ensure that their reporting is complete and replicable. To support researchers to do so, numerous efforts have been made to improve how people use ERP as a methodology, and ensure that reporting of data acquisition, pre-processing, analyses, and results are standardised. Such tools, frameworks, and guidance harbour the potential to substantially increase replicability and reliability in the field, annd tackle the ongoing replication crisis.\nThese resources provide us with an invaluable opportunity to substantially improve standards in ERP research and reporting. As the field continues to expand, the implementation of these guidelines and recommendations in ERP study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting is crucial to ensure the reliability and validity of scientific developments. However, despite the longstanding availability of such resources, their use (and adherence to their guidance) is scarce (see, for example. common under-reporting of methodological detail; infrequent use of sample size calculations).\nThe literature cited within these serves as a repository for resources that can guide every stage of your ERP research through design, data acquisition, pre-processing, and reporting to ensure that the research you produce make a valuable contribution to the field.\nNB. It goes without saying that the first resource for any ERP researcher in the making is An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique by Steve Luck. If finances are of concern (which, of course, for most students it is) consider the first edition, which contains much of the useful content and can be sourced second-hand for quite a bit less.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/erp/docs/scripts/","title":"Scripts: essential information","section":"Docs","content":"\rHow to use the scripts provided within these pages\r#\rEvery script looks a little different to the \u0026lsquo;code\u0026rsquo; line on the website. The reson for this is that the code is intended to enable you to identify what the pre-processing operation looks like in code form and to create your own scripts, whilst the scripts provided are intended to make your pre-processing more efficient, allowing you to run each pre-processing operation on all your datasets at once. This requires a little more info (i.e., where EEGLAB is stored on your computer, etc.), and therefore means that a couple of steps are necessary before you can use the scripts for your own data.\nPrepare your data files\r#\rAll the scripts features on this website require that your data is stored as follows.\nFirst, you must create a folder specifically for your experiment.\nThen you must create individual folders for each participant, with the name of the datasets matching the name of the folder exactly.\nFinally, you must ensure that all data from that participant is stored within this folder. This includes .CNT files, .fdt and .set files, and behavioural data.\nNext, you can start to tell you script where the necessary folders are on your computer in order to run. At the beginning of each script, the following will almost always be necessary:\nExample script (download).\nExample script (view).\nEnsure that for every script you run from this site, you enter the correct information as outline in the example scripts above.\nN.B.
