The website is owned \u0026amp; maintained by Jen Lewendon, postdoctoral researcher at New York Universit Abu Dhabi. For any enquiries, help, or further information, contact Jen via her personal website here.\nWhilst a myriad of resources exist for the novice ERP researcher, the information on this website aims to fill a gap. Firstly, it provies a full tutorial from instillation of EEG and ERP lab, to UI and script-based pre-processing. Secondly, it offers practice datasets, scripts and other resources to guide the ERP researcher. Finally, the resource is specifically intended to support Mandarin speaking students, offering guidance in both English \u0026amp; Mandarin.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/external/design/","title":"Designing your study","section":"External Resources \u0026 Publications","content":" Thinking about your design\r#\rDesigning you study is a key element of ERP research design. Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent aquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.\rWhilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical. Many ERP studies violate this principle, mostly because it is usually far easier to create stimuli that do not adhere to it.\nI want to run a study that examines how people respond to words that are related vs unrelated (see this article if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which component this experiment might study). Below are examples of my stimuli:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple garage\nHere, my targets (which I\u0026rsquo;ll measure my ERP response to) are psysically different. This introduces a potential secondary factor that might influence any results I find. Instead of being able to attribute any differences in my ERPs to related vs unrelated words, it\u0026rsquo;s very possible that a host of features (including the word length, orthography, frequency\u0026hellip; etc. etc.) might actually be the driving force behind any differences I find. Instead I could improve my design as follows:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple cat\nNow my ERPs are elicited by the word cat in both conditions, meaning that any physical differences between the conditions must arise purely from their relationship to the prime.\nThe Hillyard Priciple is by no means the only thing to consider in your design, but is a key design issue that necessitates further attention than it is typically afforded.

To ensure the reliability and replicability of ERP research output, it is therefore crucial that researchers avoid practises (all too common to the field) prone to result in erroneous effects, and ensure that their reporting is complete and replicable. To support researchers to do so, numerous efforts have been made to improve how people use ERP as a methodology, and ensure that reporting of data acquisition, pre-processing, analyses, and results are standardised. Such tools, frameworks, and guidance harbour the potential to substantially increase replicability and reliability in the field, annd tackle the ongoing replication crisis.\nThese resources provide us with an invaluable opportunity to substantially improve standards in ERP research and reporting. As the field continues to expand, the implementation of these guidelines and recommendations in ERP study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting is crucial to ensure the reliability and validity of scientific developments. However, despite the longstanding availability of such resources, their use (and adherence to their guidance) is scarce (see, for example. common under-reporting of methodological detail; infrequent use of sample size calculations).\nThe literature cited within these serves as a repository for resources that can guide every stage of your ERP research through design, data acquisition, pre-processing, and reporting to ensure that the research you produce make a valuable contribution to the field.\nNB. It goes without saying that the first resource for any ERP researcher in the making is An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique by Steve Luck. If finances are of concern (which, of course, for most students it is) consider the first edition, which contains much of the useful content and can be sourced second-hand for quite a bit less.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_3/","title":"Downsampling \u0026 filtering","section":"ERP Training Resources","content":"\nDownsampling \u0026amp; filtering\r#\rfiltering - high pass vs low pass\nIntro\r#\rVideo\r#\rCode\r#\rScript\r#\rDataset\r#\rActivity\r#\rFAQ\r#\r"},{"id":9,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/external/preprocess/","title":"Pre-processing \u0026 analysis","section":"External Resources \u0026 Publications","content":" Pre-processing \u0026amp; analysis\r#\rThe problem of multiple implicit comparisons\r#\rA second major issue in the design of For an excellent paper on See this article by Luck and Gaspelin (2017)\nPreprocessing \u0026amp; analysis\nKeil, A., Debener, S., Gratton, G., Junghöfer, M., Kappenman, E.
