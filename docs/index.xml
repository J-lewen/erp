      <title>1. Getting started with ERPLAB</title>

      <description>Getting started (or &amp;lsquo;help, how do I make ERPLAB work?&amp;rsquo;)#IntroTo conduct any of the analyses featured in this tutorial, you require three downloads.
Firstly, MATLAB. MATLAB is a very powerful (see also &amp;lsquo;very expensive&amp;rsquo;) software programme. However, in order to use EEGLAB MATLAB is a pre-requisite. Luckily however they offer some pretty great discounts for students, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth buying a student copy if that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility.</description>

      <description>Thinking about your design#Designing you study is a key element of ERP research design. Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent acquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.Whilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical.</description>

      <description>How to use the scripts provided within these pages#Every script looks a little different to the &amp;lsquo;code&amp;rsquo; line on the website. The reson for this is that the code is intended to enable you to identify what the pre-processing operation looks like in code form and to create your own scripts, whilst the scripts provided are intended to make your pre-processing more efficient, allowing you to run each pre-processing operation on all your datasets at once.</description>

      <description>Resampling#IntroResampling is a (relatively) simple process that can basically be thought of as deciding how much detail you want to retain in your dataset. Usually, this decision comes down to two things:
How important is it for you to measure the precise onset of your effects? Typically, I want to know roughly when my effects begin and end. By reducing the sampling rate I lose a little bit of this information, but not a huge amount.</description>

      <description>High-pass filtering#Intro
Filtering is a complex process, and requires some thought and consideration. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you read the literature on filtering to understand what you are doing to your data, and the consequences of inappropriate filtering.

      <description>Data cleaning (or &amp;lsquo;help, my data looks a mess&amp;rsquo;)#IntroPreamble: The most important thing to mention here is that there is no substitute for good quality data. You must ensure that the data you collect is the best it possible can be, because there is nothing you can do during pre-processing that can compensate for bad data. That said, even the best data will almost always have periods of noise.</description>

      <description>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (or &amp;lsquo;what do I do with all these blinks?&amp;rsquo;)#Intro
Preamble: This is not the only option for dealing with blinks. Artifact rejection is also a possibility, but will (by definition) reduce the number of trials you have per condition, and trials = power, and with great power comes great papers, or so the old saying goes. However, there are some down sides (see FAQ), so don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that ICA is a magic cure with no repercussions.</description>
