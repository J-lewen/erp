      <title>1. Getting started with ERPLAB</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_1/</link>

      <description>Getting started (or &amp;lsquo;help, how do I make ERPLAB work?&amp;rsquo;)#IntroTo conduct any of the analyses featured in this tutorial, you require three downloads.
Firstly, MATLAB. MATLAB is a very powerful (see also &amp;lsquo;very expensive&amp;rsquo;) software programme. However, in order to use EEGLAB MATLAB is a pre-requisite. Luckily however they offer some pretty great discounts for students, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth buying a student copy if that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility.</description>

      <description>Thinking about your design#Designing you study is a key element of ERP research design. Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent acquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.Whilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical.</description>

      <description>Importing data (or &amp;lsquo;help, how do I get started?&amp;rsquo;)#IntroNow you&amp;rsquo;ve got ERPLAB up and running, it&amp;rsquo;s time to have a look at some data! But how do you get your data into ERPLAB in the first place? Take a look at the video below for a brief guide to the process of importing your data.

      <title>3. Setting channel locations</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_3/</link>

      <description>Channel locations#IntroSo you&amp;rsquo;ve got your data open. But the problem is, EEGLAB has no idea which channel goes where. At present, all it knows is your channel IDs (names/numbers) if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. So your next step is to tell EEGLAB where these channels belong in relation to one another by using a location file. Luckily, the creators of EEGLAB have provided a channel file which features a database of 385 defined channel labels.</description>

      <description>Pre-processing &amp;amp; analysis#Perhaps the second major time investment in any ERP study is the preprocessing that must occur subsequent to data acquisition, before you can even begin to analyse or interpret your data. However, this is where degrees of experimenter freedom increase substantially, resulting in practices that are either intentionally or unintentionally less than ideal. In addition to this, the analyses you choose (and how you choose them) require considerable thought.</description>

      <title>4. Resampling</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_4/</link>

      <description>Resampling#IntroResampling is a (relatively) simple process that can basically be thought of as deciding how much detail you want to retain in your dataset. Usually, this decision comes down to two things:
How important is it for you to measure the precise onset of your effects? Typically, I want to know roughly when my effects begin and end. By reducing the sampling rate I lose a little bit of this information, but not a huge amount.</description>

      <title>5. High-pass filtering</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_5/</link>

      <description>High-pass filtering#Intro
Filtering is a complex process, and requires some thought and consideration. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you read around on some literature on filtering to understand what you are doing to your data, and the consequences of inappropriate filtering (particularly see this paper for a fantastic overview of the issue). High-pass filtering - the type of filter that allows the higher amplitudes to pass through but cuts out the lower amplitudes - is a really important early step in your pre-processing pipeline.</description>

      <title>6. Artifact correction (ICA)</title>

      <description>Dealing with artifacts - ICA (or &amp;lsquo;help, my data looks a mess&amp;rsquo;)#IntroPreamble: The most important thing to mention here is that there is no substitute for good quality data. You must ensure that the data you collect is the best it possible can be, because there is nothing you can do during pre-processing that can compensate for bad data. That said, even the best data will almost always have periods of noise.</description>

      <description>Interpolation (or &amp;lsquo;oops the eye electrode fell off my participant&amp;rsquo;s face&amp;rsquo;)#Intro
Whilst taking a look at your data, you may notice that certain electrodes that seem particularly noisy (i.e., fuzzy or making unpredictable leaps and falls). If this is the case, you may wish to interpolate them. Interpolation - put simply - involves recreating one electrode from its surrounding electrodes. As a function in EEGLAB, interpolation is fairly simple to carry out.</description>

      <description>How to use the scripts provided within these pages#Every script looks a little different to the &amp;lsquo;code&amp;rsquo; line on the website. The reson for this is that the code is intended to enable you to identify what the pre-processing operation looks like in code form and to create your own scripts, whilst the scripts provided are intended to make your pre-processing more efficient, allowing you to run each pre-processing operation on all your datasets at once.</description>
