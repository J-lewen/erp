      <title>1. Getting started with ERPLAB</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_1/</link>

      <description>Getting started (or &amp;lsquo;help, how do I make ERPLAB work?&amp;rsquo;)#IntroTo conduct any of the analyses featured in this tutorial, you require three downloads.
Firstly, MATLAB. MATLAB is a very powerful (see also &amp;lsquo;very expensive&amp;rsquo;) software programme. However, in order to use EEGLAB MATLAB is a pre-requisite. Luckily however they offer some pretty great discounts for students, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth buying a student copy if that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility.</description>

      <title>2. Importing data</title>

      <description>Importing data (or &amp;lsquo;help, how do I get started?&amp;rsquo;)#IntroNow you&amp;rsquo;ve got ERPLAB up and running, it&amp;rsquo;s time to have a look at some data! But how do you get your data into ERPLAB in the first place? Take a look at the video below for a brief guide to the process of importing your data.
VideoCode EEG = pop_loadcnt(&#39;C:\[DATASET ADDRESS]\[DATASET NAME].cnt&#39; , &#39;dataformat&#39;, &#39;auto&#39;, &#39;memmapfile&#39;, &#39;&#39;); [ALLEEG EEG CURRENTSET] = pop_newset(ALLEEG, EEG, 0,&#39;setname&#39;,&#39;[DATASET NAME FOR ERPLAB]&#39;,&#39;gui&#39;,&#39;off&#39;); Script Script #1 (download).</description>

      <title>3. Setting channel locations</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_3/</link>

      <guid>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_3/</guid>
      <description>Channel locations#IntroSo you&amp;rsquo;ve got your data open. But the problem is, EEGLAB has no idea which channel goes where. At present, all it knows is your channel IDs (names/numbers) if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. So your next step is to tell EEGLAB where these channels belong in relation to one another by using a location file. Luckily, the creators of EEGLAB have provided a channel file which features a database of 385 defined channel labels.</description>

      <title>4. Resampling</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_4/</link>

      <description>Resampling#IntroResampling is a (relatively) simple process that can basically be thought of as deciding how much detail you want to retain in your dataset. Usually, this decision comes down to two things:
How important is it for you to measure the precise onset of your effects? Typically, I want to know roughly when my effects begin and end. By reducing the sampling rate I lose a little bit of this information, but not a huge amount.</description>

      <title>5. High-pass filtering</title>

      <description>High-pass filtering#Intro
Filtering is a complex process, and requires some thought and consideration. It&amp;rsquo;s important that you read the literature on filtering to understand what you are doing to your data, and the consequences of inappropriate filtering.

      <title>6. Cleaning your data &amp; interpolation</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_6/</link>

      <description>Data cleaning (or &amp;lsquo;help, my data looks a mess&amp;rsquo;)#IntroPreamble: The most important thing to mention here is that there is no substitute for good quality data. You must ensure that the data you collect is the best it possible can be, because there is nothing you can do during pre-processing that can compensate for bad data. That said, even the best data will almost always have periods of noise.</description>

      <title>7. Run ICA</title>
      <link>https://j-lewen.github.io/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_7/</link>

      <description>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (or &amp;lsquo;what do I do with all these blinks?&amp;rsquo;)#Intro
Preamble: This is not the only option for dealing with blinks. Artifact rejection is also a possibility, but will (by definition) reduce the number of trials you have per condition, and trials = power, and with great power comes great papers, or so the old saying goes. However, there are some down sides (see FAQ), so don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that ICA is a magic cure with no repercussions.</description>

      <description>Epoch (or segment, or &amp;lsquo;cut up&amp;rsquo; your data#Intro
Epoching effectively cuts up your data into segments based on a given trigger, or set of triggers. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked exclusively with continuous data. What does this mean? This means that your whole EEG recording is in one long &amp;lsquo;continuous&amp;rsquo; file&amp;hellip;
