MATLAB is a very powerful (see also \u0026lsquo;very expensive\u0026rsquo;) software programme. However, in order to use EEGLAB MATLAB is a pre-requisite. Luckily however they offer some pretty great discounts for students, so it\u0026rsquo;s well worth buying a student copy if that\u0026rsquo;s a possibility. Universities will also often have a MATLAB license that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use either on campus, or link to via your personal computer.\nNext, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download EEGLAB. EEGLAB is super handy open-access software intended for research purposes. EEGLAB is a necessary pre-requisite to ERPLAB, with which we\u0026rsquo;ll conduct most of our pre-processing.\nSteps: Download EEGLAB from the above link. Extract the folder, then open MATLAB. Navigate to \u0026lsquo;set path\u0026rsquo;, which you can find in the Home tab in the Environment section. Select \u0026lsquo;Add Folder\u0026rsquo; and navigate to the EEGLAB folder. You may then wish to select EEGLAB in the \u0026lsquo;MATLAB search path\u0026rsquo; list and move it to the top, with the help of the \u0026lsquo;Move to top\u0026rsquo; button on the left-hand side. For more details, click here\nFinally, you will need to download ERPLAB, some more great open-access software that will enable you to conduct pretty much any pre-processing operation you could want.\nSteps: Download ERPLAB from the above link. Extract the folder, Then place the extracted ERPLAB folder into your EEGLAB plugins folder.\n(e.g., C:/Users/Jen/Documents/MATLAB/eeglab2022.0/plugins/)\nN.B I am in no way affiliated with any of the above mentioned companies/products/resources.

The website is owned \u0026amp; maintained by Jen Lewendon, postdoctoral researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi.\nWhilst a myriad of resources are available for the novice ERP researcher, the information on this website aims to fill a gap. Firstly, the ERP Training Resources pages aim to provide a full tutorial from instillation of EEG \u0026amp; ERP lab, to UI or script-based pre-processing and analysis. This should support the user with no prior MATLAB or EEGLAB/ERPLAB experience to get started with EEG data pre-processing. The course also offers practice datasets, scripts, and other resources to consolidate learning and allow for hands-on practice of the full pre-processing pipeline without the need for the user to acquire or source their own data. The course is particularly geared to support Mandarin speaking students to familiarise themselves with the often complex terminology and concepts of pre-processing, offering a wealth of translated content.\nSecondly, the External Resources \u0026amp; Publications section of this website provides a repository of key literature to guide the learner through every stage of the ERP research process, from experiment design, data acquisition, pre-processing \u0026amp; analysis, and reporting. I do claim any ownership of these resources, but find them very useful in my own research.\nThirdly, the Resources for Researchers section features a number of databases and tools that may prove useful for ERP researchers conducting research into auditory ERP responses. This comes from my own work, and is mostly unpublished resources.\nFinally the Teaching Material section combines both my own materials and external content to help design course content at tertiary level for ERP studies.\nYou are free (in fact, welcome) to use all and any of the resources on this site.

Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent acquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.\rWhilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical. Many ERP studies violate this principle, mostly because it is usually far easier to create stimuli that do not adhere to it.\nI want to run a study that examines how people respond to words that are related vs unrelated (see this article if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which component this experiment might study). Below are examples of my stimuli:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple garage\nHere, my targets (which I\u0026rsquo;ll measure my ERP response to) are physically different. This introduces a potential secondary factor that might influence any results I find. Instead of being able to attribute any differences in my ERPs to related vs unrelated words, it\u0026rsquo;s very possible that a host of features (including the word length, orthography, frequency\u0026hellip; etc. etc.) might actually be the driving force behind any differences I find. Instead I could improve my design as follows:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple cat\nNow my ERPs are elicited by the word cat in both conditions, meaning that any physical differences between the conditions must arise purely from their relationship to the prime.\nThe Hillyard Priciple is by no means the only thing to consider in your design, but is a key design issue that necessitates further attention than it is typically afforded.

To ensure the reliability and replicability of ERP research output, it is therefore crucial that researchers avoid practises (all too common to the field) prone to result in erroneous effects, and ensure that their reporting is complete and replicable. To support researchers to do so, numerous efforts have been made to improve how people use ERP as a methodology, and ensure that reporting of data acquisition, pre-processing, analyses, and results are standardised. Such tools, frameworks, and guidance harbour the potential to substantially increase replicability and reliability in the field, and tackle the ongoing replication crisis.\nThese resources provide us with an invaluable opportunity to substantially improve standards in ERP research and reporting. As the field continues to expand, the implementation of these guidelines and recommendations in ERP study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting is crucial to ensure the reliability and validity of scientific developments. However, despite the longstanding availability of such resources, their use (and adherence to their guidance) is scarce (see, for example. common under-reporting of methodological detail; infrequent use of sample size calculations).\nThe literature cited within these serves as a repository for resources that can guide every stage of your ERP research through design, data acquisition, pre-processing, and reporting to ensure that the research you produce make a valuable contribution to the field.\nNB. It goes without saying that the first resource for any ERP researcher in the making is An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique by Steve Luck. If finances are of concern (which, of course, for most students it is) consider the first edition, which contains much of the useful content and can be sourced second-hand for quite a bit less.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/erp/docs/scripts/","title":"Scripts: essential information","section":"Docs","content":"\rHow to use the scripts provided within these pages\r#\rEvery script looks a little different to the \u0026lsquo;code\u0026rsquo; line on the website. The reson for this is that the code is intended to enable you to identify what the pre-processing operation looks like in code form and to create your own scripts, whilst the scripts provided are intended to make your pre-processing more efficient, allowing you to run each pre-processing operation on all your datasets at once. This requires a little more info (i.e., where EEGLAB is stored on your computer, etc.), and therefore means that a couple of steps are necessary before you can use the scripts for your own data.\nPrepare your data files\r#\rAll the scripts features on this website require that your data is stored as follows.\nFirst, you must create a folder specifically for your experiment.\nThen you must create individual folders for each participant, with the name of the datasets matching the name of the folder exactly.\nFinally, you must ensure that all data from that participant is stored within this folder. This includes .CNT files, .fdt and .set files, and behavioural data.\nNext, you can start to tell you script where the necessary folders are on your computer in order to run.

Resampling","section":"ERP Training Resources","content":"\nResampling\r#\rIntro\rResampling is a (relatively) simple process that can basically be thought of as deciding how much detail you want to retain in your dataset. Usually, this decision comes down to two things:\nHow important is it for you to measure the precise onset of your effects? Typically, I want to know roughly when my effects begin and end. By reducing the sampling rate I lose a little bit of this information, but not a huge amount. For example, by resampling my data down to 250 Hz I introduce an error of ±2 ms. This is fine for the research I do, but if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in super precise comparisons of the onset of an effect for which 2 ms error would be problematic, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to keep your sampling rate higher. However, this brings us to the next consideration\u0026hellip;\nHow much space do you have on your computer? EEG datasets are typically quite big. Usually you need a reasonable number of them. If you want to run two studies that are both about an hour long, with 40 participants for each and to keep you data at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, you\u0026rsquo;re going to quickly use up a lot of space on your computer. Beyond this, your pre-processing is going to take longer. For simple things such as re-referencing your sampling rate won\u0026rsquo;t make much difference, but for more complex processes such as artifact correction, the increase in time can be quite significant. If you can afford to lose a little bit of temporal resolution, it\u0026rsquo;s usually worthwhile resampling to a lower rate.\nVideo\nCode\nScript\nDataset\nActivity\nFAQ\nCan I resample to a different sampling rate than 250 Hz?\r↕\rFor most experiments, a sampling rate of somewhere between 200 - 1000 Hz is ok. Lower sampling rates will mean that your data files are smaller, and processes steps such as ICA run faster. Higher sampling rates make your datasets larger, but give you more fine-grain detail, which can be particularly useful if you want to explore the latency of a response.\r"},{"id":9,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/external/preprocess/","title":"Pre-processing \u0026 analysis","section":"External Resources \u0026 Publications","content":" Pre-processing \u0026amp; analysis\r#\rThe problem of multiple implicit comparisons\r#\rA second major issue in the design of For an excellent paper on See this article by Luck and Gaspelin (2017)\nPreprocessing \u0026amp; analysis\nKeil, A., Debener, S., Gratton, G., Junghöfer, M., Kappenman, E.
