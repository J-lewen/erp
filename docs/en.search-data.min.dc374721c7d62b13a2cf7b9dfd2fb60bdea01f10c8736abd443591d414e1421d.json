The website is owned \u0026amp; maintained by Jen Lewendon, postdoctoral researcher at New York Universit Abu Dhabi. For any enquiries, help, or further information, contact Jen via her personal webpages here.\nWhilst a myriad of resources exist for the novice ERP researcher, the information on this website aims to fill a gap. Firstly, it provies a full tutorial from instillation of EEG and ERP lab, to UI and script-based pre-processing. Secondly, it offers practice datasets, scripts and other resources to guide the ERP researcher. Finally, the resource is specifically intended to support Mandarin speaking students, offering guidance in both English \u0026amp; Mandarin.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/external/design/","title":"Designing your study","section":"External Resources \u0026 Publications","content":" Designing your study\r#\rDesigning you study is a key element of ERP research design. Multiple considerations can guide your design to ensure that valuable time spent aquiring, pre-processing and analysing data produces valuable (and hopefully publishable) results.\rWhilst I list a number of resources here, one main considerations that most ERP research overlooks one important principle. Termed the Hillyard Principle (see Luck, 2014), by Steve Luck, the basic premise that ERP responses should be elicited by stimuli that are - in principle - physically identical. Many ERP studies violate this principle, mostly because it is usually far easier to create stimuli that do not adhere to it.\nI want to run a study that examines how people respond to words that are related vs unrelated (see this article if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which component this experiment might study). Below are examples of my stimuli:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple garage\nHere, my targets (which I\u0026rsquo;ll measure my ERP response to) are psysically different. This introduces a potential secondary factor that might influence any results I find. Instead of being able to attribute any differences in my ERPs to related vs unrelated words, it\u0026rsquo;s very possible that a host of features (including the word length, orthography, frequency\u0026hellip; etc. etc.) might actually be the driving force behind any differences I find. Instead I could improve my design as follows:\nPrime Target\nRelated: dog cat\nUnrelated: apple cat\nNow my ERPs are elicited by the word cat in both conditions, meaning that any physical differences between the conditions must arise purely from their relationship to the prime.\nThe Hillyard Priciple is by no means the only thing to consider in your design, but is a key design issue that necessitates further attention than it is typically afforded.

The use of ERP methodology involves numerous degrees of freedom. To ensure the reliability of event-related potential research, it is therefore crucial that researchers avoid practises (all too common in the field) prone to result in erroneous effects, and incomplete reporting. To support researchers to do so, a number of efforts have been made to improve how people use ERP as a methodology, and ensure that reporting of data acquisition, pre-processing, analyses and results are standardised. Such tools, frameworks, and guidance harbours the potential to substantially increase replicability and reliability in the field, and tackle the ongoing replication crisis.\nThese resources provide us with an invaluable opportunity to substantially improve standards in ERP research and reporting. As the field continues to expand, the implementation of these guidelines and recommendations in ERP study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting is crucial to ensure the reliability and validity of scientific developments. Notably however, despite the longstanding availability of such resources, underreporting of a priori predictions for both experimental findings and ERP characteristics; methodological detail; sample size calculations; pre-processing; and analysis persists in ERP literature.\nThe literature cited within these four pages seek to serve as a repository for resources that can guide every stage of your ERP research through design, data acquisition, pre-processing, and reporting.\nNB. It goes without saying that the first resource for any ERP researcher in the making is An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique by Steve Luck. If finances are of concern (which, of course, for most students it is) consider the first edition, which contains much of the useful content and can be sourced second-hand for quite a bit less.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/training/part_2/","title":"Import data \u0026 downsampling","section":"ERP Training Resources","content":"under construction\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/erp/docs/table-of-contents/external/preprocess/","title":"Pre-processing \u0026 analysis","section":"External Resources \u0026 Publications","content":" Pre-processing \u0026amp; analysis\r#\rThe problem of multiple implicit comparisons\r#\rA second major issue in the design of For an excellent paper on See this article by Luck and Gaspelin (2017)\nPreprocessing \u0026amp; analysis\nKeil, A., Debener, S., Gratton, G., Junghöfer, M., Kappenman, E.
